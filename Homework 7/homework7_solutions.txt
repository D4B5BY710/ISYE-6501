# ISYE6501 Homework #7: Optimization in PuLP

Question 15.2
The data is given in the file diet.xls.
1. Formulate an optimization model (a linear program) to find the cheapest diet that satisfies the maximum and minimum daily nutrition constraints,
 and solve it using PuLP.

2. Please add to your model the following constraints and solve the new model:
    a. If a food is selected, then a minimum of 1/10 serving must be chosen.
    b. Many people dislike celery and frozen broccoli - one, but not both, can be selected.
    c. At least 3 kinds of meat/poultry/fish/eggs must be selected.


1. Formulated optimization model minimal cost is $4.34.

Constraints are:
 - maximum and minimum daily values of each nutrient

 Optimization Solution:
 52.64371 units of foods_Celery,_Raw
 0.25960653 units of foods_Frozen_Broccoli
 63.988506 units of foods_Lettuce,Iceberg,Raw
 2.2929389 units of foods_Oranges
 0.14184397 units of foods_Poached_Eggs
 13.869322 units of foods_Popcorn,Air_Popped


2. Formulated optimization model minimal cost is $4.51.

Constraints are:
 - maximum and minimum daily values of each nutrient
 - chosen foods bounded between .1 and M(large constant)
 - only one of broccoli and celery can be in the optimal diet
 - at least three proteins must be selected in the optimal diet

 Optimization Solution:
 42.399358 units of foods_Celery,_Raw
 0.1 units of foods_Kielbasa,Prk
 82.802586 units of foods_Lettuce,Iceberg,Raw
 3.0771841 units of foods_Oranges
 1.9429716 units of foods_Peanut_Butter
 0.1 units of foods_Poached_Eggs
 13.223294 units of foods_Popcorn,Air_Popped
 0.1 units of foods_Scrambled_Eggs
