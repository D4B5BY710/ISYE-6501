# Week 4 Notes De- Trending

trends only really appear in time series data
trend: increase or decrease of data over time
we can adjust for certain trends to get to the real pattern in our data
de-trending - trend can mess up factor based analysis
trends can skew the response!
we can de-trend the response and the predictors!
- consider to do this on any factor based model!

How do we de-trend?
factor by factor
example: one dimensional regression
we can simply modify the response if we know the adjustment factor (i.e. gold example)
if we know the inflation rate we can subtract that rate from the price then model the response adjusted for inflation
- we might not know the data in the past
- go factor by factor and fit a linear regression for each predictor
- de trended price = the price - the models estimate of price by year!

# summary:
- de trending approach is simple
- it works well to remove trend effects for time series data
- helpful for factor based (predictors) analysis
