# week 4 notes confusion matrix comparison

measures of model quality to evaluate model's quality and choose the best model for the problem
add the cost into our model performance
we can set up costs for each of the confusion matrix outputs
combine them all together to get the overall cost based on model
we can use this cost and the confusion matrix to evaluate models
cost will balance the true positives and true negatives in overall model performance
