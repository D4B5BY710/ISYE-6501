# Week 4 Notes Advanced Regression

advanced methods related to regression - brief descriptions of each method
some are parametric and some are not
parametric - no form of the underlying predictor data

Poisson Regression:
- regression when response follows a Poisson distribution
- poisson = f(z) = lambda^Z * e^-lambda / z!
- this models count data
- example: count arrivals at an airport security line
- estimate lambda(x)

Spline Regression:
- spline is a function made up of polynomials that connect to each other
- polynomials connection at a knot
- fit different functions to different parts of our data sets
- we want to find smooth connections between the parts - this ensures we do not have drastically different answers for close values
- order k regression spline means the polynomials are all k order polynomials
- multi-adpative regression splines = MARS or EARTH models

Bayesian Regression:
- start with data
- but we also start with some estimate of how regression coefficients and the random error is distributed
- bayes regression is often most helpful when we don't have much data to start with
- bayes theorem can give us an updated estimate based on these prior distribution assumptions
- we essentially combine expert opinion with data to temper each to give accurate models
- if we do not have expert opinion we can choose a very broad prior distribution and use it a seed data that can be adjusted by the data we do have

K Nearest Neighbors Regression:
- KNN version of regression instead of classification
- plot all the data we have - find the k nearest points of new point - then take the average of the neighbors to give regression estimate
- we can do more things: weighting each dimension of distance, remove dimensions that are not predictive
- quick and easy method to implement
