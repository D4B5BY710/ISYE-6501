# Week 4 Notes PCA

PCA = principal component analysis
- this is a type of feature extraction
- useful for highly correlated and highly dimensional data

how do we deal with a model with many predictors?
- which ones are important?
- example:
- does the past performance of any stock indicate how well the market will perform?
- we have +6000 securities
- can add many more predictors to the model (wars, attacks, election results, natural disasters)
- two difficulties: 6000+ predictors even without interactions!
- we would need lots of data to model this system without overfitting!
- can we reduce the number of features we need or the number of data needed?
- some of the predictors might be highly correlated with each other!

PCA addresses both problems at once!
- PCA transformation the data by rotation - PCA is a linear combination of the entire feature space
- it then ranks coordinates by importance after removing correlations within the data
- concentration on the first n principal components reduces the effect of randomness
- earlier principal components are likely to have higher signal-to-noise ratio
- but be careful - pca reduces correlation to explain variance of the predictors without seeing the response!
- need to scale before running pca - different magnitudes will alter the pca groupings which chases after explaining any variance (even variance given by scale)

pca rotates our plots (think of two dimensional graph shifted on axis)
we then represent our once correlated data in new x and y coordinates such that there no longer is correlation!
we call our new dimensions D1 and D2
PCA will recognize which dimension is wider (more variance) and assign that dimension as the first dimension!
we can use just D1 to represent the two factors! it will explain more variance in our data!


# summary:
principal component analysis:
- used for high dimensional and correlated data
- PCA attempts to remove these correlations (rotation) and rank them by importance (variance explained)
- next we will cover the actual math behind PCA
