# homework #2

due 5/31 at Thursday 2am
peer assessments are due for real now
homework assignments get to drop two of the lowest homeworks

homework #2:
k means clustering
outliers clustering
change detection

question 1: K Means clustering
 - we know the clusters beforehand
 - in real life we wouldn't be able to check the correct answers
 - what could be a good combination of predictors to cluster on?
 - examine correlation with correlations plots
 - need to scale the data beforehand (scale for modeling)
 - scale matters in predictions not in correlation
 - explain the clusters and what they mean - examine the cluster centers
 - should we include high correlation or low correlation measures?
 - plot each measure against each other to look at natural clusters
 - correlation = greater than .7
 - R^2 naturally increases based on predictors included...this will not generalize well
 - R^2 adjusted - increases of R^2 regularized by the number of predictors included
 - non-correlated hurting you? not hurting you? include higher correlation explain why getting clusters?
 - scale the data beforehand with function scale
 - scaling is important: prediction can go south if predictors are in different magnitude
 - higher scaled predictors will have more weight than other factors - equal consideration for all predictors
 - we want values to be important not because of their magnitude but their actual attribution to the model
 - judge on total within sum of squared distance (totalwithinss) = tot.withinss
 - judge on Total sum of squared distance as well (totss)
 - try different nstarts (i.e. n = 20); random starts in the algorithm given the number of clusters we are using
 - try different k for 1 through 15
 - plot the elbow plot on total totalwithinss to recommend best K value
 - want to see greater diminishing returns in terms of total within sum of squared distance
 - highly correlated variables seem to be better to cluster on - including highly correlated values seems to make performance better!
 - use table to see the results of the predicted cluster values against the actual cluster values
 - or predict the training data based on distance between the cluster centers - assign and check actual accuracy
 - use table to show the differences between the true clusters and our model clusters

 question 2: outliers
 - look at density plot
 - look at boxplot - possible potential outliers?
 - type = 11 = opposite tails outliers
 - check scale of the data crime[1:20,]?
 - try top and bottom tail outliers
 - typical level is .05
 - two tailed may mask the effect of one outlier on one tail!
 - include all the data in the crime data - double check if we are just using the last column or not...

 question 3: cusum change detection
 - use the library qcc
 - need a center value - mean - with no change this is just for summer only!
 - need a sd for the entire column - sd with summer only!
 - check to make sure that we are in the same format to answer the questions
 - # of shifts = threshold value for what determines a change
 - threshold value - sd * our se.shift parameter
 - note this is the cumulative change is more than two se.shifts out!
 - this helps us determine if the change is just random noise or an actual change for good!
 - key here is the mean in the summer not the overall mean of all years all months!
 - 6.2.1 = each year ; Day Temp, St (cumulative sum) ; cusum for each year! when does the change actually occur?
 - 6.2.2 = Day of change, Temp, St (cumulative sum);
 - for each year when summer ends and the Temp = are we shifting later or earlier
 - for all years: are we getting hotter or colder as summer changes to fall
 - the idea is to use mean summer temperature when we want no change!
 - use the day of the change occurred and the temperature to determine if summer if happening earlier or if end of summer is getting warmer!
 - possible to do cusum for day and year? check it out...
