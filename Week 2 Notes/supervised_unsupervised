# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

classification - separate data into groups
clustering - also separate data into groups

what is the difference?

what we know about that data beforehand

classification we know the attributes and the 'answer' - which observations fall into which groups

clusterings we do not know the 'answer' rather just want to explore what clusters of groups are available in our dataset

this is the idea behind supervised and unsupervised learning:
- classification = supervised we known the answer
- clustering = unsupervised clustering is built with no 'end goal' in mind

supervised learning: when we observed the right answer for each data point and the repsonse is known
unsupervised learning: correct answer or response is not directly known
- both use the attributes to determine the method's outputs
