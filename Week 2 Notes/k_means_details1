# Practical K Means Details

clustering - grouping data points
k means heuristic machine learning algorithm

what should we do with an outlier?
it might not really be apart of our clusters
it can have high influence over the making of the clusters
we should learn about these outliers and what they mean!

the algorithm can just be a guide!
the best professionals practice the art of analytics


k means is a heuristic machine learning algorithm:
- it is a good model, but not guaranteed to find the best solution
- it runs fast
- if we run it several times we will get different initial starting clusters each time!
- we can then choose the best solution
- we compare each of the final clustering to dial-in to the best cluster solution
- we can also tune for the number of optimal clusters to use

won't more clusters always be the better solution? No it won't
we want clusters that can be explanatory and don't want too many to reduce interpretation
if we use a lot of clusters we will have one cluster for every data point
this doesn't tell us anything useful about our data
we want the number of clusters that minimize the distance a significant amount based on the number of clusters added
this means we want the minimal amount of clusters than minimize the cluster distance the most
this it typically the k vs. distance graph - we want to recommend clusters on the 'elbow' of the graph

tune the solution by qualitative and quantitative values
qual: 5 new fire stations? not initialize city cluster for 8 clusters
quant: take a look at the total distances comparison vs. the total number of clusters

the marginal benefit may be minimal for adding a new cluster
remember the 'elbow' chart to determine optimal k value
this is a good start at finding clusters to use - consider your problem!

k means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique!
we do not have the official answers - we are asking the machine to find 'best' clusters based on distance for us!
