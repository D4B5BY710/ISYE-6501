# Change Detection Details

detecting change can be very valuable
- manufacturer performance
- change of sales based on promotion
- railroad example where we need a flexible approach to detect change quickly

this lesson focuses on the CUSUM:
- cumulative sum
- has the mean of the observed distribution gone beyond a critical level
- can help us detect increase versus mean, decrease versus mean or both

suppose we have some data:
x sub t is the observed value at time t
x^t might be the price of a stock, temperature of railcar at time t
mu is the expect value of x if no change
for each observation xt - mu is how far the observation is away from the typical observation at time t

CUSUM metric:
St = max{0, St-1 + (xt - mu - C)}
- determine is St >= T?
- basic idea is to calculate a metric St and declare when we observed a change when the metric goes over threshold T
- at each time period we observe xt and see how far it is from the expectation
- then we add that amount to the previous periods metric St-1, - this is the running total St
- if the running total is greater than 0 we keep it
- if less than zero we reset the running total to 0
- this helps us quickly determine if there is change
- if below zero (in the above case) we ignore it - it doesn't matter we are detecting if greater than a threshold
- we do not want to be too sensitive and say there is a change too early
- we expect some randomness
- we include a regularization parameter C to pull the running total down
- the bigger C is the harder it is for St to get larger - the less sensitive the method will be
- the smaller C is the easier it is to say a change has been detected - this is more sensitive St can get large fast

CUSUM is a simple mathematical method to implement quickly
how do we choose the right values of C and T?
- we want quick detection but not overly sensitive
- C and T are model parameters that we have to use data to find the right values
- this decision depends on cost - how long it takes to detect change vs. cost of false positives

part of the right setting of C and T involves trading off these costs

let's examine this trade-off:
we look at setting C and T correctly

artificial bake the example to have a change to see how long CUSUM determines there is a change
depending on C and T it will take longer to see the actual change
trade off between detection time and false positives!

we can also use CUSUM to detect decreases: look for negatives and decreases under threshold
we can also use CUSUM to detect both: set thresholds for both and detect mean changes over and under expected

there is also a good way to visualize:
- 'control chart'
- we plot St over time and if it ever gets beyond the threshold line it shows CUSUM has detected a change

there are other methods of change detection but CUSUM is simple
important takeaway: basic idea of tradeoff between early and false detection
- changes can be detected by observing the difference in time value away from the mean
- CUSUM is a method to detect change - we calculate a running total of differences from expected value and compare it against a threshold
