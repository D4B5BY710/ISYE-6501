# Clustering - Distance Metrics

Distance Norms
straight line euclidean distance method
distance between points is:

distance = sqrt[(x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y2)^2]
- this is the euclidean straight line distance

distance = abs[(x1 - y1)] + abs[(x2 - y2)]
- this is the rectilinear distance
- notice the absoluate value
- also known as Manhattan distance - grid distance for cities

both of these can be generalized:

distance = sqrt^p[abs[x1 - y1]^p + abs[x2 - y2]^p]
- p = 1 for rectilinear distance
- p = 2 for euclidean distance

we can further generalize this to n dimensions:

distance = sqrt^p[sumofndimensions(abs[xi - yi]^p]
- sum over all n dimensions
- this is known as the p-norm distance
- where p is the parameter for type of distance
- this is also called the Minkowski distance

p is a parameter - we can tune this parameter to be any p would want
the third most common value is infinity:
the infinity norm distance
this is the distance as p approaches infinity

How does the infinity norm work?

substitute p for infinity in our distance calculation
distance = sqrt^inf[sumofndimensions(abs[xi - yi]^inf]

our distance is translated into the largest of our values...
therefore = sqrtinf[maxi * abs[xi - yi]^inf]
the largest i raised to infinity will dominate all other values in the sum!
sum equals the largest abs[xi - yi] to the infinity distance

the infinity norm is very simple - it simplifies to the largest absolute set of numbers!

= 'the biggest'

questions:

when do we use infinity norms? or norms in general?

example: warehouse optimization
machine moves to right place and the up and down time
the time is the exact distance to move to the right aisle and then move up to the correct location
this is the 2-norm time problem: the time is aisle distance + height distance!


say we want the machine to move down the aisle and start moving to the right height at the same time??
this is a smarter algorithm - and utilizes a different distance calculation to optimize
the time it takes is the larger of the two times: either isle distance or height distance
what ever is higher is the time the machine takes! this is the infinity distance
