# Outlier Detection

this lesson is about outliers:

data points that are very different from the rest of the data
how to find them and how to account for them

outlier: data point with the value very different from the rest of the data
- ex. a point outlier

outliers encompass a philosophical debate

contextual outlier - outlier the depends on the context of the other data
outlier by omission - missing data that the other data shows is missing - collective outlier
 - data that shows the entire set may be an outlier

it is easy to look at pictures and find outliers -
how do we do this automated?
what do we do when we know we have them?

to find point outliers in one dimension - we could use a box and whisker plot
the top and bottom of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles of the distribution of the values
horizontal line is the median value - 50th percentile
whiskers stretch to a reasonable range of values
we plot points outside the reasonable range as possible outliers

what we could do for multiple dimensions:
 - fit a model
 - then examine points with the most amount of error
 - these high error points could be outliers!


summary:
- point outliers
- contextual outliers
- collective outliers

what do we do?

outlier detection:
- automated methods
- box and whisker or other visualizations
- modeling error or residuals
