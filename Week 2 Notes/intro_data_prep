# Intro to Data Preparation

this lesson:

Data Preparation:
 - using specific data in our analysis: predictors, factors etc.
 - examples:
      credit scores
      average temperature
      number of hot dogs sold
      price of stocks
      amount of a chemical in drinking water

we can have numeric and qualitative data that we need to prepare them

we sometimes need to scale our data to use it in algorithms

scales can magnify results that are not true

scale of data: be aware of possible outliers
extraneous information:
  - complicates the model bogging it down to bad performance or interpretability

we need to address these before building our models!

summary:
- examples of quantitative data
- potential problems within the data
- will learn how to prepare the data for our particular model
