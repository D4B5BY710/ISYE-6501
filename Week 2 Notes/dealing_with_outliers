# Dealing with Outliers

what are outliers? how do we find them?

what do we do with outliers?

this depends on how the data becomes outliers

outliers can be:
- bad data: sensor fails, contaminated experiment, wrong input
- real data the is a part of the true data

we need to look into where the data came from
need to look for how it was compiled
unique situations surrounding the data preparation, modeling steps

we will have to look deeper to try to explain why and outlier is and outlier
this will guide how we handle outliers in our processes

understanding outliers and dealing with them correctly will ensure the model is validate and analysis is valuable

if just bad data: we might omit the outliers
or we can impute the the missing or bad values

if correct data: we have to think about the system
if enough true randomness we should have some "real" outliers
if normal distributed - 4% of the data will be more than 2 standard deviations away from mean - outliers
this scales with data - more data points means more observations will look like outliers
do we consider these outliers as apart of this model?
if the magnitude of the model's error is part of the measure of its value - maybe we should keep our outliers

ex. weather events can be 'real' outliers that really occur in the data
if we throw these out we will not be modeling truth

we can build models to estimate the probability of these outliers happening i.e. logistic regression model
then build another model to estimate the values with the outliers removed

some outliers are not predictable and might need to be removed even if it is a systematic outlier

summary:
 - outliers aren't predictable sometimes
 - investigate the data just in case you are wrong
 - outliers can be real and apart of the system of data - valid outliers to model
 - outliers can be bad data and can be removed
 - even true outliers can be removed if the situation calls for it
- investigate your data
