# Introduction to Change Detection

change detection - what is it? what are some examples?

change detection - determining whether something has changed

example: time series data
most change detection has a time attribute

examples: look at the data to see if we need to do something
 - variance in machine needs maintenance or is it normal variation
 - has sales of our product changed?
 - whether an action we took had any impact
 - did policy change have an actual effect?
 - did promotion actually effect sales?
 - are there any differences over time?
 - changes in voting patterns?

- how do we identify when traffic is starting to build up and will be a problem in the future but not now
- railroad safety: axle temperature predict when to warn based on high temperature of axle
- we can have false readings - every high reading might not be meaningful
- if we wait to really make sure - we may be too late
- we used hypothesis testing: but to meet the strict threshold took a long time and the railroad could already breakdown
- there are other ways to determine the change more quickly but we trade-off some false positives to get there
