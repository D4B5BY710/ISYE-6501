# K Means Clustering

clustering - splitting a dataset into groups of points based on similarity or Distance

k means clustering is a machine learning algorithm that solves a clustering problem

say we have a dataset that we want to divide into clusters
SUV example: age and temperature

we have xij = attribute j of data point i

yik = cluster membership = 1 if in cluster, 0 if not in cluster

zjk = coordinate of cluster center k

our objective:
- minimize the distance of all data points in a cluster to their respective centroid
- this can be written as:
minimize(y,z) = sumofi sumofk sqrt[sumofj[xij - zjk]^2]
- the second part of this equation is the distance
- we minimize this function to sumofk yik = 1 for each 1

- this is a long way of saying minimize the distance between each distance from
data point to centroid for each datapoint in the overall cluster

- we add up all the distances from each point in the cluster and aim to minimize these distances
- we also force each data point to be included in exactly one cluster

this is actually a hard optimization problem to solve!

K Means:
decide how many clusters
K = the number of clusters
in the data we set up 3 arbitrary cluster centers
then we assign each data point to the cluster it is closest to
we then re-calculate using the data points assigned to our arbitrary cluster
once we re-calculate - we may have to re-assign the data points against to different clusters
we continue this process until we have minimized the distance between all points in the cluster relative to the cluster center
iterate until no data point changes clusters and we have our final clusters!

k means can generalize to a many dimensions

k means is a machine learning algorithm but it is also a heuristic algorithm!
- heuristic = fast, but not guaranteed to find the absolute best solution
- in many cases it does get close to the best solution and does it fast
- it is also a Expectation Maximization Algorithm (EM)
   - we alter the expectation step and then the maximization step over and over

Expectation - Maximization Algorithm (EM)
we calculate cluster centers - mean of the cluster - finding the expectation
when we re-assign data points to new clusters this is the maximization step
- we are minimizing finding the smallest distance to a cluster center
our algorithm takes turns shifting from the expectation and maximization steps over and over
