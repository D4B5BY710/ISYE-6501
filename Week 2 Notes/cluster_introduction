# Introduction to Clustering
Week 2 - Lesson 1 - notes

what is it?
what does it answer?
how do we find good clusters?

take a set of data points and divide them into similar groups
we want points in the cluster close to each other

targeted marketing - segment customers and send different messages

SUV - highlight size, vs size, price, look cool etc.
each set of people will be a cluster we can market to

clustering helps discover clusters too

personalized medicine - who reacts to personalized treatment
locating civil facilities - where to put your store?
image analysis
initial data investigation and exploratory data analysis

two dimensional SUV graph:
age and # of children in a household

the catch is we can create as many clusters as possible...
how do we create a good cluster?

machine learning helps us determine the optimal cluster!
