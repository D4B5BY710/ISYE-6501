# Clustering for Prediction

clustering - splitting data points into groups based on similarity

k means can also be used for prediction

we take in new data points a fit it into the closest cluster based on similarity
we try to match it to the closet to the cluster center

what range of possible data points can we assign to each cluster?
we can map the entire space to see which data points fall into any cluster
think of the predicting Voronoi diagram
all space is mapped by distance to our closest data points
