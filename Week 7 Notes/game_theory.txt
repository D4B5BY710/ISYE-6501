strategy# Week 7 Notes: Competitive Models

- competitive decision making
- previous models = 'us against the data'
- descriptive models = get understanding of reality
- predictive models = find hidden relationships and predict the future
- prescriptive models = find the best thing to do assuming the system does not react
- what if the system reacts intelligently?
- we need to use analytics to consider all sides of the system

 Examples:
 - pricing examples
 - using past purchase data and competitor data to price products
 - one price is set competitors may change their price more - giving different results than the model
- government = corporate tax policies
- companies need to decide how to store and spend their money based on tax revenue of the government
- employee incentives to change behavior

- need to consider not just your own situation but the competitive situation
- these situations need competitive decision making = game theory
- cooperative game theory = competitive and cooperative game theory

Timing:
- make decisions simultaneously
- can't change once made
- strategy = counter strategy > counter-counter strategy = best strategy after many iterations
- sequential game = decision made in series

Types of Strategies:
pure strategy = just one choice
mixed strategy = randomize decisions according to probabilities
example = rock paper scissors
pure strategy will eventually lose
mixed strategy will work best

Information Levels:
- perfect information: know all the information for everyone's situation
- imperfect information: some have more information than others - competitive advantage - not symmetric across competitors

No Sum and Nero Sum:
- whatever one side gets the other side loses and vice versa
- bet $1 on game: get dollar vs. lose dollar
- non-zero sum: total benefit might be higher or lower
- example = economics

Summary:
competitive decision making = game theory
how do we determine the best strategy? = optimization models
we want to find the optimal strategy!



# Week 7 Notes: Game Theory Models

basic demo of game theory models
how does it work
what analysis is involved?

Game Theory Example:
- two gas stations
- set price: $2 or $2.50
- same price = 50 / 50 demand
- otherwise = all demand will go to lower priced one
- what's the best price to choose?
- talk to each other and set at $2.50 - half demand at the higher profit margin
- it matters the cost to determine what the price should be chosen!
- stable equilibrium = no incentive to change
- prisoner's dilemma = incentive to agree to higher price and then back out and charge the lower price
- can choose any price points they want
- both can keep lowering prices until price is about equal to the cost
- "race to the bottom" = simple model will cause each to lower prices until they meet the margin
- competition drives down price for consumers
- game theory says there is incentive to charge slightly lower price than competition
