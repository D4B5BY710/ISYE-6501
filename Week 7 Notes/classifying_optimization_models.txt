# Week 7 Notes: Classification of Optimization Models

- optimization models:
- engine of statistical models
- can be used 'on their own' to model prescriptive problems
- based on the math some optimization models can take longer than others

how do we classify optimization models?
- x = vector of variables (variables)
- objective function: minimize or maximize f(x) our objective function (objective function)
- variables x must belong to a set X: subject to x in X (constraint)

Linear Program:
- f(x) is a linear function
- constraint set X is defined by linear equations and inequalities
- minimize or maximize C + sumof(ci * xi)
- easy and fast to solve even for very large instances

Convex Quadratic Program:
- f(x) is a linear function
- constraint set X is defined by linear equations and inequalities
- minimize f(x) or maximize -f(X)
- easy and fast to solve even for very large instances; not as fast as linear programs

Convex Program:
- objective function f(x) is:
- concave (if maximizing)
- convex (if minimizing)
- constraint set X is a convex set
- easy to solve but solutions can take a lot longer

Integer Program:
- linear program plus: some of all variables restricted to only take integer values
- variables can be binary (0 or 1)
- more difficult to solve even with good software (and takes a long time to solve)


General Non-Convex Program:
- optimization problem is not convex
- extremely hard to find optimal solutions


Optimization Rank:
1. linear
2. convex quadratic
3. convex
4. integer
5. general non-convex

what do we do if an optimization problem is too hard to solve?
- heuristic: rule of thumb process
- usually gives adequate solutions for certain analytic problems
- not guaranteed to find the optimal solution

Network Program:
- type of a linear program
- solved extremely quickly = more quickly than normal linear programs
- location (node / vertex)
- connection (arc /edge)
- xij: variable for arc from i to j (how much flow there is)
- constraints: flow into a node = flow out of a node
- constraints: flow on arc between min and max is allowable
- objective function: linear function of variables
- this is a network model we can solve quickly using specialized algorithms
- if the data is all integer then there will be an optimal solution where all the variables have integer values - even without us enforcing this constraint

common network models:
- Google Maps, GPS
- optimal route = shortest route problem
- assignment model = which workers get which job to maximize workforce efficiency
- maximum flow model = how much of oil can flow through a complex network of pipes?

what happens if we are not certain of our input data?
- there might be some uncertainty in our estimates, forecasts, system behavior?
- how do we deal with these uncertainty problems?
