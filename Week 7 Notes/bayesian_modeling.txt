# Week 7 Notes: Bayesian Modeling

- bayesian models are sometimes counterintuitive

Bayesian Probability:
- based on basic rule of conditional probability
- bayes' rule
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
- example: medical test
- true positives: 98%
- false positives: 8%
- 1% of the population and 8.9% of people test positive
- if someone tests positive what is the probability someone actually has the disease?
- write out the equation in bayes' rule
- A = has the disease
- B = tested positive
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 98% * 1% / 8.9% = 11%
- even after testing positive a person only has a 11% of having the disease
- why?
- so many more people don't have the disease = many more false positives than true positives


Empirical Bayes Modeling:
- overall distribution of something is known or estimated
- only a little data is available for the problem
- ex. predicting basketball outcomes NCAA
- difference X in points scored by home team and road team
- approximately normal: X ~ N(m + h, simga^2)
- h = home court advantage
- m = true difference in the teams' strength (unknown)
- simga^2 = variance
- bayes rule allows us to figure out the unknown m
- first model the difference between teams' strengths m ~ N(0, tau^2)
- then look at observed data:
- x = observed point difference in game
- m = real difference between two teams, with m != x
- bayes' rule: look for the probability of having a true points difference given the observation x
- P(M = m | X = x) = P(X= x | M = m)*P(M=m) / P(X = x)
- probability of m given x!!
- if team a beats team b by x points we could find the distribution of how much one team is better
- we could also integrate that distribution (zero to infinity) to show the probability that a team is actually better!
- P (home team better | X = x) = integral(P(M = m | X = x)* dm)

what are we actually saying?
- home team won by 20 points
- estimated home court advantage h = 4 points
- standard deviation in team strength difference tau = 6 points
- standard error from random variance sigma = 11 points
- of the 20 point victory:
- about 4 points was home court advantage
- about 12.5 points due to random variation
- only 3.5 points due to the difference between teams
- this seems counterintuitive: 20 points win just 3 point difference?
- there is a lot more variance due to randomness
- 20 point win is more likely to happen due to randomness
- bayes rule shrinks the estimate to a more normal distribution

Summary:
- take a single observation
- combine with broader set of observations
- then make a deduction or prediction
- bayesian models work especially in the absence of lots of data


P(A) = prior distribution
P(A|B) = posterior distribution
