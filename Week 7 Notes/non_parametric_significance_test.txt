# Week 7 Notes: Non-Parametric Methods

- hypothesis tests assume the underlying distribution we are testing against
- sometimes this is not the case
- all we have is responses and we don't have a good model for the distribution
- these are non-parametric tests

McNemar's Test:
- used to compare results on pairs of responses
- data points where two different approaches were used on the same thing
- ex. viruses on Treatment A and Treatment B - which is best?
- Treatment A: 61% of virus killed
- Treatment B: 68% of virus killed
- is B actually better or is the difference due to random chance?
- ...it depends...

Scenario 1:
- consider the case:
- 32 cases neither treatment worked
- 61 cases: both A and B worked
- 7 cases: B worked but A did not
- 0 cases: A work and B did not
- in this case we could conclude B is better (p = .02) - accept

Scenario 2:
- consider the case:
- 12 cases neither treatment worked
- 41 cases: both A and B worked
- 27 cases: B worked but A did not
- 20 cases: A work and B did not
- in this case we could conclude B is not better (p = .38) - reject
- it is hard to tell which treatment is actually better

- McNemar's Test:
- throws out all the cases where the results are the same
- then tests using the binomial distribution to see whether we'd expect results this extreme
- Scenario 1: 2% chance we'd see these results by luck
- Scenario 2: 38% chance we'd see these results by luck (good chance)
- we don't need to know anything about the underlying distribution
- it is just a comparison of paired results


Wilcox Test:
- Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for Medians
- assumption: distribution is continous and symmetric
- is the median of the distribution different from m?
- given responses y1...yn
  1. rank |y1 - m|, ..., |yn - m| from smallest to largest
  2. W = sumof_yi>m(rank(yi - m)) = sum of all ranks only where yi > m
  3. p-value test for W
- if the probability p of getting a sum of ranks at least as extreme as W is small...
- then we can say that the median is probably different from m
- p-value - approximate normal distribution table
- can use wilcox test to test two sets of paired samples having the same medians?
- are the ranks of two observation sets are likely to be different
- given pairs (y1, z1), ... ,(yn, zn) from observatins y and z
- use |y1 - z1|, ..., |yn - zn| for rank test

when do we use these tests?
- numeric data = wilcox
- categorical / binary = mcnemar


Mann-Whitney test:
- all observations are independent of each other
- rank both sets of values and compare to the distribution
- two data sets but not paired samples
- given independent observations y1,...,ym and zi,...,zm
  1. rank all observations together y1, ..., yn, z1,...,zm
  2. U = smaller of two adjusted rank sums:
     U = min{Uy, Uz}
         Uy = sumof(rank(yi) - n(n+1)/2)
         Uz = sumof(rank(zj) - m(m+1)/2)
  3. find significance of U - need software or table



Summary:
- Non-parametric = no underlying distribution
- even when nothing is known about underlying distribution we can use these tests
- two data sets:
- MN test = paired yes / no
- WSRT = paired numeric data
- MWT = unpaired data
- one data set:
- WSRT = compare possible median
- there are more non-parametric tests too
- even when we do not know anything about the underlying processes that create the observations...
- we can still use relative ranks or outcomes of two competing approaches to see whether the difference between them is significant
