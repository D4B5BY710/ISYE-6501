# Week 7 Notes: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

- used to react to patterns that we don't even understand
- CAPTCHA type of questions
- idea of deep learning is to train a system to react to without knowing what it is reacting to
- powerful in image recognition and speech recognition, NLP


Neural Networks:
- neural networks are modeled after the way neurons work in our brains
- Artificial Neural Network
- three levels of neurons:
- input level, hidden level, output level
- input > hidden > output
- each input accepts a single piece of information
- each neuron: gets inputs from previous layer > calculates function of weighted inputs > gives it output to next layer
- there might be several layers of hidden layer neurons
- finally we reach the output is the combination of all weighted hidden layer results
- the output layer chooses the 'best' answer based on the results from all the hidden layers
- then the results are fed back through the entire system and re-weighted based on the incorrectness of the first output
- simple is gradient descent to do this
- if the network learns well with enough data all of the weights will be adjusted so that the network generates correct outputs from the input
- require a lot of data to train
- hard to choose and tune the learning algorithm: re-weight too fast or too slow can be problematic


Deep Learning:
- idea of neural networks adapted for more layers
- similar approach to neural networks = input > "deep" layers > output > restart with re-weights
- powerful in NLP, speech, image recognition
