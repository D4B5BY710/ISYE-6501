# Week 8 Notes Discussion Format

- course covered many analytics models
- overview of analytics has been complete
- now we are in the case study part of the course
- think carefully about how to approach each case using analytics
- what models would fit the problem best?
- what data would we need for our models to work well?

- use two tools: discussion form and analytics knowledge

- think of answer first
- discuss with small group
- discuss with larger group
- at the end write up own solutions for homework

formatting framework:
- given {data}, use {model / technique}, to {result}


example:
- given {child's age, sex, height}...
- use {linear regression}...
- to {predict the child's height}

example:
- given {amount of crude oil available at port}...
- use {an optimization model}...
- to {determine the best pickup, delivery, routing schedules}

example:
- given {traffic data on websites}...
- use {ARIMA and GARCH}...
- to {predict the mean and variance of each website 5 min into the future}
- then
- given {predictions from ARIMA / GARCH}...
- use {simulation model}...
- to {suggest the break-even price for advertising on each of the web sites in the next 5 minutes}

- use this format to guide your thinking and describe ideas to others
