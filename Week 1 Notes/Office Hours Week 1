# Office Hours May 17th 2018
general office hours regarding course structure
discussion of C and trade-off between margin and accuracy / error in ksvm
programming recitation on R basics
insight into HW 1

course is 12 weeks long
piazza is the main source of communication with class
will be for professors and TAs
will monitor discussion board to make sure questions are answered

ISYE 6501X  is the official piazza board
you can post private and public questions
you can email the instructors exactly

the first homework has more information to help get used to the homework structure
also get used to the submission structure
get used to coding in R and functions and the data manipulation this course will take

Homework 1 gets you up to speed with what is expected
do we need to review certain courses? - homework 1 will let you know

homework 1 due May 23rd
we are compressing 15 weeks worth of material in 12 weeks
course will cover a lot of material very fast
we will ramp the fuck up - strap in bitch
can you handle the speed bitch!?

5 mins per video about 2 hours per week
homeworks are usually more coding and should be around 10-15 hours per week
homework are based on videos but we will need outside information
the material the homework covers will be in the homework...
but the programming to do the homework is NOT covered!
learn this shit and google it

use the R documentation read this first!
get it from the source!! pure information!!

notes will come during the weekend for general R help
also check out lynda.com for R help - can use GTx credential

homework:

Question 1: general question

Question 2: svm and knn

Question 3: svm and knn and cross validation

for kknn we need to make additional models for each dataset?
loop through each observation to fit a model?

both datasets will work - they just need headers or no headers
both datasets are the same to use

python will be required for simulation lessons
we will need SimPy, PuLP in python to cover simulation libaries
week 5 or week 6 is the simulation lessons

homework 1 - R is enough
R will be covered through the first 4 weeks

switch to python in week 6 and 7 for simulation
learn the data structures in python: lists, dictionaries, arrays, looping etc.

can work with python if you are more comfortable

homework format should be:
  - document to describe the code and outputs
  - the actual Code
  - solutions do not have to match exactly
  - make the solution easy for the reviewer to see the thought process and results
  - should provide your own code
  - users should not be there to debug code
  - focus on the interpretation makes sense and is reasonable
  - you need to explain your output!!!
  - solutions in Rmarkdown are acceptable
  - submit as pdf or word document if possible

this is a analytics course
answers can be variable there are no 'hard answers'
the idea is to learn how to apply methods - not grade harshly on the homework
trying to prepare a data analysis for your boss
you need to explain your results?

grades questions - contact instructors privately

exams will be multiple choice and drag and drop
no coding will be available in the exams
allowed one sheet of paper for first quizzes
allowed two sheets of paper for final exam
no coding but will be asked about certain functions covered in class
midterms are 1.5 hours
final are 3 hours
you will have 10 days to take the exam
one sitting to take an finish the exam
have time within 10 days to take the full exam in one sitting


only one chance to submit homework
will not be available to re-submit

everything is available in the syllabus
getting started section of the course within EdX

definitions and glossary to study terms
located in the EdX platform
will be useful to study for the exam

should not have to memorize formulas if we have a cheat sheet


assignments will only be released one at a time
once the due date passes the next assignment will be posted

grading policy - need to review other students to get complete grade
need to submit and complete peer reviews on time to get a grade
3 peer reviews are needed to get a homework grade


videos and homework will not be released early
peers will be assigned to you automatically
peer reviews will be anonymous

programming recitation will be to help your homework in R


what is difficulty from exam to homework?
homework = coding and programming
exam = multiple choice, drag + drop test the understanding of the lecture material
making a through cheat sheet will be very important
functions, definitions, will be needed on your cheat sheet
without a good cheat sheet exam will be extremely helpful

sample quiz will be available for the proctoring process and the type of questions asked
sample will be for midterm #1


overall will be coming soon this weekend!
videos will be recorded for all programming videos and office hours
