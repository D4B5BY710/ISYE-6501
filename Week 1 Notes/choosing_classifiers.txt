Choosing a Classifier

what are the trade-offs in building classification models?

we want to put things into categories!

should we give someone a loan?

we draw a line to sort groups into classification groups...
what is the right line to draw?

which one should we chose - the line that it further from making mistakes!
we might not have all the data - we want find the line that is not close to
make misclassifications

what if it is impossible to avoid making classification mistakes...
i.e. no line to separate between points?

we need a 'soft' classifier rather than a 'hard' classifier
we need as good as separation as possible - minimize the number of
misclassified points

we want to trade off between actual mistakes and 'near' mistakes
not all mistakes are equal!

the best separator - the most costly one type of decision is the further we
shift our line away from this group!

we can set a high classifier in order to limit cost of classification errors
we can use the same idea for 'soft' classification also!

we can tell from our decision line which variable is important to the
classifier based on the scatterplot between the two variables

horizontal line = the classifier only takes the vertical access into account
vertical line = the classifier only takes the horizontal axis into account
