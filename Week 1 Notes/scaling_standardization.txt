Scaling and Standardization

two common data preparation tasks - scaling and standardization of our data points

consider this example:
 - svm model
 - classifying loan applicants into credit risk categories
 - based on credit score, and household income
 - these variables are scaled very differently
 - we aim to draw to parallel lines that correctly classify each point while...
 - maximizing the margin between the two parallel lines
 - the actual classifier is the line exactly between these parallel points

the classifier is the line 0 = a0 + Σ aj * xj
we maximize the gap by minimizing Σ aj^2

the sum of squared coefficients: Σ aj^2 = 5^2 + 700^2 = 490,025

what if we make a small change to the credit score coefficient?

new sum of squared coefficients: Σ aj^2 = 5^2 + 701^2 = 491,426 (+1,401)

how much would we need to change the income coefficient to get this same level?

new sum of squared coefficients: Σ aj^2 = 37.8^2 + 700^2 = 491,426
  - this requires a large difference in the first coefficient
  - our resulting line is very different from the original line
  - data is not on the same scale
  - small changes to the large magnitude variable: huge swings in our plotted line
  - large changes to the small magnitude variable: little swing in plotted line

 the sum of squared coefficients will be sensitive to changes in coefficients
 our SVM model will not perform well

 Scaling Data:
 we scale our data down to the same interval
 common scaling: data between 0 and 1
 scale factor by factor:
  - let xminj be the min of xij
  - let xmaxj be max xij
  - for each data point i:
     - xij scaled = (xij - xminj) / (x maxj - xmin j)

general scaling between B and A:
  - xij scaled = xij scaled[0,1] * (A - B) + B


Standardization:
scaling to a normal distribution
scaling to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
factor j has mean uj = (Σ xij) / n
factor j has a standard devation of σj
for each data point i:
  - xij standardized = (xij - uj) / σj


when do we want to use these?

scaling - important to have data within a bounded range
   - nueral networks
   - optimization
   - we need values to be restricted between certain values

standardization - important to use in PCA and clustering

in some cases its not clear which works better!

it is often necessary to scale or standardize the input data
should be used throughout this course
'its not just a good idea - it's the law' = not quite but it is a good idea
