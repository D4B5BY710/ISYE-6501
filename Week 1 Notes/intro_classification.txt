Introduction to Classification

classification = putting things into categories
put into groups of 'yes' and 'no'

many analytic questions need to bin answers into a group based on the past
examples

we can use classification models to sort these items into these groups

we can also have multiple classification groups - not just 'yes' or 'no'

we need data to get these answers!
we can infer and model from the data to classify a new point into the correct
group!

credit score and income example: scatterplot
if repaid - green
if defaulted - red
these points could have an entire set of features associated with it
we can draw a decision line between the points and sort them based on our
decision line

there are many lines! how do we know the 'right' line
they could all separate the groups evenly!
