- Introduction to Analytics Modeling

answer important types of questions:
  what happened? = descriptive
  what is going to happen? = predictive
  what actions are best? = prescriptive
  how do we create value with data?

when can analytics answer these questions?

Modeling: taking a real life situation and expressing it in math
analyze in math and turn it into a solution

best ways to learn: ask questions, discuss answers

Course Structure:
- knowledge building
- experience building based on knowledge built in part 1

Knowledge Building:
  Models - learn all the models
  Cross Cutting - data prep, output quality, missing data
  will include mathematical intuition but keep it agile
  all developed with situations and examples
  basic mathematical detail

Experience Based:
  case studies
  practice using models
  practice using models using the commonly used analytics softwares
  make sure you learn key basic concepts
  link material with real analytic questions
  develop learning beyond the videos
  learn to use software without being told exactly what to do

Summary: knowledge building and then experience
