SVM: what does the name mean?

if we have a set of points and connect the dots - we get the convex hull
this looks like a shape floating in space that could fall down
a line that 'holds up' this convex hull is called a support vector

support vector can be supporting from any side or the top
we can have multiple lines supporting our geo shape

in classification we want two lines that maximize the margin between the
two groups - two parallel lines that are as far apart as possible
these two lines are support vectors!

the support vector machine is a machine that automatically determines the
best 'support vectors' (parallel lines) that support our classification space!

these lines correctly classify the data points while maximizing the distance
between the two parallel lines!

the machine does this automatically and is why we give it the name:
Support Vector Machine

the classifier we are looking for is between the two vectors - the classifier
is not one of the lines touching the support vectors!!
