Data Definitions

what data comes up in analytics?
what terminology do we use in different types of data?

important to understand the analytic vernacular

Data Tables:
  rows are data points
  columns are variables - information about each data point - features, predictors
  response - the outcome column or the data point we want to predict - this is a column

Data Types:
  Structured - described and stored in a structured way
  Unstructured - cannot be stored easily - ex. written text

Structured Data:
  quantitative - numbers with meaning
  categorical - numbers without meaning - categories of data - numbers denote groupings
  binary - takes on 1 or 0, takes on two values only!
  unrelated data - no relationships between data points
  related data - data linked together - time series data - recorded at the same intervals
