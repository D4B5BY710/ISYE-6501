# Week 5 Notes Experiment Design

introduction to design of experiments
- we assumed we already have data
- data can be easily collected
- this is not the case...
- getting the full set of data is impossible or will take too long
- we need: DOE collect best subset quickly and efficiently
- need to make sure the data we get will be sufficient to answer our questions
- how to make our data representative of all our factors?

Design of Experiments (DOE)
- comparison and control: compare two things but need to control for other factors
- need to match across comparisons across other factors than the study we are setting up
- need to control for the effects of our other variables
- data has the same mix
- or breakdown the data into smaller sets to test all important factors

- blocking: creating variation
- type is a blocking factor that we can account for
- we want to reduce the variability by eliminating variation on certain factors
- sports cars more likely to be red
- analyze red sports cars and red family cars in separate sets to reduce variance
