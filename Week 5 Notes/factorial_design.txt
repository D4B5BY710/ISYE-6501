# Week 5 Notes Factorial Design

A / B testing - compare between simple alternatives

Factorial Design: what factors are import?
- test effectiveness of every combination in our ads (full factorial design)
- after testing them all - basic anova can tell which are important
- testing combinations quickly scales outside the realm of possibility (fractional factorial design)
- limit the tests to a subset of important subsets first then test to see most important factors

design depends on data
- fractional experiment design might be more feasible
- we can cleverly design our choices to be 'representative' of all different options
- i.e. test attributes across the minimum number of cases to get full representation of each choice
- balanced design:
- test each choice the same number of times
- test each pair of choices the same number of times
- good designs are essential to creating a representative test
- independent factors:
- test subset of combinations
- use regression to estimate effects
- regression can model the response as 'clicks' based on each of the factors included (if independent factors)

Key Takeaway:
- all of these DOE methods can be helpful when they are used for modeling or even before the data is collected!
- factorial design can be a powerful tool to determine the best comparisons to make and explain the results of the final choices
