# Week 5 notes A / B Testing

- use analytics to pick the best set of different alternatives
- using design of experiments to A / B test
- collect some data
- randomly serve up ads and track how they are clicked
- we will have binomial ads based on clicks for each banner add
- we can use a basic hypothesis test to determine which add is better
- can do hypothesis testing on the fly
- this is A / B testing: choosing between two alternatives

to do A / B testing we need to satisfy these three things:
1. collect data quickly (lots of data)
2. data must be representative of entire population
3. data must be small compared to the whole population (need a smaller slice of the total traffic)

- common approach in marketing
- what about several alternatives?
- how do we figure out the best alternative?
- we don't want to waste trials on bad alternatives - how do we manage this?
- how to be test multiple factors accounting for our 'budget' of possible test cases?
