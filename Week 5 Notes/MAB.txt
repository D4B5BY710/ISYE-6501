# Week 5 Notes Multi-Armed Bandit

determine the better of two alternatives
- AB testing - try it out an test which is better
- hypothesis test
- we can also test factors in factorial design

exploration vs. exploitation
- there is a cost for each test - we may be losing value
- the number of tests can be wasted on tests
- say we find after 1000 tests that option A was the best: all tests with option B would have been wasted
- these wrong adds are lost value
- trade off between being sure are losing value in testing
- balance benefits from more information vs. getting more value
- this is exploration vs. exploitation
- exploration - certainty in knowing the correct answer
- exploitation - maximizing immediate value
- this is the multi-armed bandit problem
- slot machine = one armed bandit (negative expected value)
- several slot machines = different expected payout - only way to find out is to test them all

- multi-armed bandit:
- start with k alternatives:
- start with no information - equal probability of selecting each alternative
- run some tests and gather some information
- update our probabilities based on our initial tests
- then assign new tests skewed towards the new probabilities
- we are testing multiple options so we are still exploring...
- but we are skewing our tests to try and take advantage of exploitation
- do this until answer is absolutely clear of the best case
- it might take longer to get to the clear answer but we will have attempted to maximize value by shifting choice to the 'hot' choice in terms of success

- MAB parameters
- # of tests between recalculating probabilities
- how to update our probabilities of success
- change how we assign new tests

no simple rule but works better than fixed large number of tests
- worthwhile: learn faster on the fly and create more value
