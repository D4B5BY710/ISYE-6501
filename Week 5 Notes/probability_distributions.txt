# Week 5 Notes Probability Distributions

probability distributions
- sometimes simple approaches work better
- can use simple probability distributions instead of modeling a bunch of factors
- probability models can model certain problems that allow us to 'skip' factor based modeling
- matching data to a probability distribution can give insight
- important when we only have the response or hard to get new data

focus on which distributions will be good for modeling:

Bernoulli: more flexible coin flip
p = 'heads'
1 - p = 'not heads'
can model any event
- very useful when we string the event probabilities together
- Bernoulli trials - the probability p of our event stays the same from time period to time period
- test: observe successes and use the distribution to see what the probability is to get that same number of successes
- this is the binomial distribution: we can examine the probability mass function
- probability of getting x successes out of n independent identically distributed Bernoulli trials
- binomial distribution converges to normal distribution
- P(X = x) = (n x) p^x(1 - p)^n-x
- as n gets very large the binomial distribution converges to the normal distribution
- normal distribution is useful for predicting errors

Geometric Distribution:
- PMF: P(X = x) = (1-p)^x * p
- probability of having x bernoulli(p) failures until first success
- or flipped, x bernoulli (1 - p) successes until first failure
- we have to be careful of how we define p and 1-p in this distribution
- we can compare data to geometric to test whether i.i.d is true
- if something fits the geometric distribution then we can assumme i.i.d will hold
- this is a way to check if an outcome is actually being treated as independent!

Poisson Distribution:
- fx(x) = lambda^x * e^-lambda / x!
- good at modeling random arrivals
- lambda is the average number of arrivals
- probability x people arrive given lambda (average arrival rate)
- this assumes that arrivals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)

Exponential Distribution:
- related to the poisson distribution
- models the inter-arrival time
- if arrivals are poisson with lambda arrival average time
- the time between successive arrivals is an exponential distribution (lambda)
- poisson arrivals = exponential inter-arrivals time and vice versa
- PMF: fx(X) = lambda * e^-lambda*x
- 1 / lambda is the average inter-arrival time

Weibull Distribution:
- amount of time it takes for something to fail
- similar to geometric exempt time passed instead of instances
- PMF = fx(x) = k / lambda * (x / lambda)^k-1 * e^-(x/lambda)^k
- lightbulb: how many flips before failure = geometric
- lightbulb: how long to leave lightbulb on before failure = Weibull
- additional parameter k
- K < 1 = models when failure rate decreases with time 'worse things fail first'
- K > 1 = models when failure rate increases with time 'things that wear out'
- K = 1 = failure rate is constant with time
- when k = 1 weibull reduces to exponential distribution

how do we tell is our data fits one of these distributions?
- fit to best distribution and give the best fit parameters for the fit = software
- can also fit to many different models at once to figure out the best distribution
- warning: only use software as guide - data may have random noise in it
- think about what the output means before using it!
