# Week 5 Notes Q-Q Plots

probability based models:
-visualize whether two distributions are the same
- see if data is similar to a distribution
- visualization is important to see what the software is outputting

Q-Q Plot:
- idea of this plot is that whatever variations in the data
- even if the number of data points in two sets is very different...
- two similar distributions should have about the same value at each quantile
- ex. in each of the two datasets the value that at the 10th percentile should be close to the same for each distribution
- this should be true at any percentile if the distributions are similar
- the q-q plot show this graphically
- plot median vs. median for each distribution
- do this for all percentiles - sample 1 vs. sample 2
- want a 45 degree line to say that the distributions match
- this would be the same as a statistical test - but the plot let's us see why (where are the distributions different)
- raw statistical test can be misleading (small tail differences)
- we can compare two datasets or just one dataset to compare to a other distribution
- compare the actuals to the 'perfect' simulated distribution to see if there is a good match
