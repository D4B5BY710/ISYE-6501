# Week 5 Notes Variable Selection

what do we do with a lot of factors in our models?
variable selection helps us choose the best factors for our models
variable selection can work for any factor based model - regression / classification

why do we not want a lot of factors in our models?

- overfitting: when the number of factors is close or larger than number of data points our model will overfit
- overfitting: model captures the random effect of our data instead of the real effects
too many factors is the same idea - we will model too much of the random effects in our model
with few data points overfitting can cause bad estimates
if too many factors our model with be influenced too much by the random effect of that data
with few data our model can even fit unrelated variables!

- simplicity: simple models are more easier to interpret
- collecting data can be expensive
- with less factors less data is required to production the model
- fewer factors - less chance of including factor that is meaningless
- easier to explain to others
- we want to know the why? hard to do with too many factors
- need to clearly communicate what you model is doing

fewer factors is very beneficial!

building simpler models with fewer factors helps avoid -
- overfitting
- difficulty of interpretation
