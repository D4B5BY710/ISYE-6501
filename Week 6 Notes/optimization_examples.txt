# Week 6 Notes: Modeling is Art

example 1 - the diet problem (US Army)
- needed to satisfy soldiers' nutritional requirements at minimum cost
- n foods
- m nutrients
- aij = amount of nutrient j per unit of food i
- mj = minimum daily intake of each nutrient j
- Mj = maximum daily intake of nutrient j
- ci = cost per-unit of food i

- how do we fit all of this into our variables, constraints, objective function template?

Variables (decisions):
- xi = amount of food i in daily diet
- x broccoli = is the amount of broccoli in a solider's daily diet

Constraints:
- sumof(aij * xi) >= mj for each nutrient j
- sumof(aij * xi) <= Mj for each nutrient j
- they require that the daily intake of nutrient j is between lower and upper limit
- aij * xi = amount of nutrient j the soldiers gets from food i each day
- add this up over all foods and we have the total daily intake of nutrient j
- obvious constraint: xi >= 0 == impossible to eat negative amounts of food

Objective Function:
- minimize sumof(ci * xi)
- for each food i we multiply the per unit costs ci by the units of the food eaten (xi)
- this finds the money spent on that food each day
- adding up over all foods given the total cost of the diet

- we can also consider variety, seasonal costs, taste, combinations of foods



example 2 - call center scheduling
- meet forecasted demand di for each day of week i
- workers work 5 days in a row and then have two days off
- minimize workers days used
- variable: xi = number of people working on day i
- objective function: minimize xd for all days in a week
- constraints: meet demandL xi >= di for all days i
- constraints: integer workers = xi is integer for all days i
- how do we meet the contractual requirements? (5 days working w/ two days off?)
- this is difficult - we started with the wrong set of variables!

- new variable: xi = number of people who start working on day i
- example: x sunday = number of people working through Sunday - Thursday
- new objective function: minimize 5(xi of each day in week)
- new constraints: meet demand: sumof(xj) >= di
- example: xfriday + xsaturday + xsunday + xmonday + xtuesday >= demand tuesday
- obvious constraints: xi >= 0 for all days i, xi is integer for all days i
- the contractual obligations are written into the model
- optimization model is an art not exactly a science...yet!
