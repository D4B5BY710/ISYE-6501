# Week 6 Notes Prescriptive Simulation

how to use simulation for analysis = Prescriptive analytics
- asking what-if questions (what would change if we did this?)
- modify the parameter of the simulation and compare the results
- some simulation software has ability to determine optimal parameter setting our our simulation


Simulation Comparisons:
 - run simulation with different parameters
 - compare the system performance between the performance of each set of parameters
 - be careful:
 - one set of 'random' observations could be better than another set by random chance
 - avoid this by using the same random numbers
 - this requires it's own statistical analysis - are the means different for each set of observations?
 - using the same random numbers is a non-parametric test  that can tell us about our system

 Simulation can be a powerful tool:
 - model is only as good as quality of input
 - missing or incorrect information may lead to incorrect answers
