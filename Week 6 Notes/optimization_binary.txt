# Week 6 Notes: Modeling with Binary Variables

optimization can be used to answer prescriptive questions
variables, constraints, objective functions
by introducing binary variables into the model we can add complexity

Example: Stock Market Investment
- invest to balance return and risk
- B = investment budget
- n = number of stocks available
- ri = expected return of stock i relative to market
- Qij = covariance of returns of stocks i and j

- variables: xi = amount invested in stock i
- constraints: sumof(xi) <= B (our budget); xi >= 0 for all stocks i (no short selling)
- objective function:  maximize [sumof(ri * xi) - theta * sumof(i)*sumof(j) Qij * xi * xj]
- where ri * xi is the expected return
- the theta term is the risk term
- this is the Markowitz model proposed as a theoretical framework
- how would we change this to build an investment strategy?

- transaction fees
- we can create yi if invested in or not
- we can add a component to the objective function subtracting out the sumof(t*yi)
- this is the modeling of the transaction price
- this is called a fixed charge
- we also need to link the constraints: xi <= Byi for all stocks i
- xi >= mi*yi for all stocks i (we need to meet minimum investment stock - have to invest at least mi in stock)
- ytesla = 1, yamazon + ygoogle + yapple >=1 (invest in tesla, in amazon, google or apple)
- yfedex = yups (invest in both or neither fedex or ups)
- ycoke = 1 - ypepsi (invest in exactly one of coke and pepsi)
- personal investment constraints: sumof(yj >= 5yi) for all energy stocks
- binary variable: zengery = 1 if invest in energy, 0 if not == sumof(yj >= zengery); zengery >= yi for all energy stocks i

integer variables can be used to write special features as constraints in a model
- optimization modeling is an art!
- we can model with binary variables:
- fixed charges in objective function
- constraints to choose among options
- constraints requiring same / opposite decisions
- if-then constraints
