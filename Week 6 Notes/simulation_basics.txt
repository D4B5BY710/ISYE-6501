# Week 6 Notes Simulation Basics

simulation - build a model and watch its behavior

types of simulation:
- deterministic = same inputs give the same outputs (no randomness)
- stochastic = use when system has randomness

- continuous time simulations: changes happen continuously
- discrete event simulations: changes happen at certain time points only

- DES:
- valuable when systems have high variability
- using average values is not good enough
- random variability can mess up our processes

Simulations: Arena software for simulation
- elements of model include:
- entities: things that move through a simulation
- modules: parts of process
- actions
- resources
- decision points
- statistical tracking
- create and connect elements to each and add in the associated probability distributions

Under the hood:
- pseudo random number generations, tracking, animation

Replication: number of runs of simulation
- one replication = one data point (may be unrepresentative)
- run multiple times to get distribution of outcomes
- important to validate simulation against actual real life data!
- use real data to validate your simulation
- real and simulated averages don't match = problem
- averages match, variances don't match = problem
