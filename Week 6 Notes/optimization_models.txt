# Week 6 Notes:  Optimization Models

Optimization:
- key component of almost all statistical learning procedures
- can provide descriptive and prescriptive analytics
- good software for solving models exists but...
- building models requires human insight and expertise


Elements of Optimization Models:
- Variables, Constraints, Objective Function

Variables:
- decisions that the optimization solver will pick the best value for
- example: political candidate scheduling:
- xi = total time spent in state i
- yi = number of visits to state i
- zi = 1 if state i is ever visited, 0 is never visited
- wid = time spent in state i on day d
- vid = 1 if state i visited on day d, 0 if not
- if built correctly optimization software will pick the right values for each item we want to know

Constraints:
- restrictions on those decisions that we make
- restrictions on the values of the variables
- example: political candidate scheduling:
- constraint: 30 days left in the campaign: sumof(xi) <= 30
- we want candidate to visit specific state
- sumof(v, state, d) >= 3 = at least 3 state visits in days 24-30
- total visits must add up correctly: sumof(d, vid) = yi
- this is an important constraint: optimization solvers only look at the math to solve
- solver needs to the constraints to model the real life problem

Objective Function:
- measure of the quality of our optimization solution
- the quality of a set of values for our variables which we are trying to maximize or minimize
- example: political candidate scheduling:
- the objective function might measure how many additional votes we could expect based on schedule
- maximize expected new votes == objective function for our example
- sumof(alpha * population (state i) * sqrt(xi + .33* sumof(xj)) + B*vid*fd)
- how do we know these values?
- in order to use optimization models we need to use other models to determine the correct parameters
- optimization sometimes requires output from other models as the inputs to the optimization model

- solution: value for each variables
- feasible solution: variable values that satisfy all constraints
- optimal solution: feasible solution with the best objective value
- optimal means best!

- variables - decisions to be made
- constraints - restrictions on variable values
- objective function - solution quality measure
