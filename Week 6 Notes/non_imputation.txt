# Week 6 Notes Non-Imputation Methods

- data sets are often incomplete with missing data
- dealing with missing data:
- throw it away
- use categorical variables to indicate missing data
- estimate missing values

Throw Away:
- not potentially introduce errors
- easy to implement
- don't want to lose too many data points
- potential for censored or biased missing data
- throwing these 'powerful' missing data out will hamper our model
- part of the model will be biased to the data we do have

Categorical Variable:
- add a categorical 'missing category' to the normal data
- is quantitative - add zero?
- this can lead to problems if missing data is important to cause
- one approach is to include an interaction term between the missing value 0 and the categorical column (missing yes / no)
- create two separate models - one for is missing vs. one for is not missing

this lesson covered:
- remove missing data completely
- add categorical variables
- both attempt to estimate what missing data may be in our model
