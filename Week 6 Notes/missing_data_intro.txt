# Week 6 Notes Missing Data

- analytics models are based on data
- we assume we know all the data
- what if some of our data is missing?

- data goes missing all the time (think of the system!)
- machines, humans all break down over time
- unavailable data
- missing Data
- wrong data
- often patterns in missing or wrong data
- outliers - data so wrong from another data points

- patterns in missing data
- some data are more likely to be missing
- values of one type or more likely to be missing than others
- example: income (higher income more likely to omit - this is bad)
- there can be a bias in the missing or given data we have

- we need to choose the best way to handle missing data depending on why the data is missing!
- choose method on a case by case basis!
