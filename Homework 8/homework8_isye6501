My analytics solution for the Power Company follows this general format:

	- Given {Customer Payment History, Family Composition, Age, Estimated Household Income,
    Estimated Home Value, average Energy Consumption, Energy Consumption Trends,
    Macro-Economic Factors, Weather, Energy Costs}
	- Use {flexible classification model - random forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting}
  - To {identify customers who are most likely to never pay their energy bill}
  - Given {Customer Location, Probability to never pay}
  - Use {clustering algorithm}
  - To {group clusters of high probability no pay customers together in close areas - visualize these geographically}

The end result a recommendation each month to send the minimum amount of workers to the least costly,
highest value geographic clusters to perform shut-offs. I would also recommend trying to preemptively solve the problem by
pushing a message to high probability customers asking them to state their intentions of payment. Using this outreach and the
model's classification probabilities - we could set up an experiment to optimize which customers would be most responsive to our
outreach. Not only would sending a message to customers be less costly - the results from this experiment could also add additional
information to help us decide which clusters, and how many technicians we should send on the shut down run.

Here are the components of my analytics solution - aiming to explain the thought process for my choices.
