# Week 3 ARIMA

time series analysis - other methods


ARIMA = Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average

Three key parts of ARIMA:

Differences:
estimate St based on xt, xt-1, xt-2 etc.
our equation shows we are trying to estimate a new time period based on all previous time periods
this generally works well if data is stationary
if the mean, variance and other measures are constant over time = stationary data
not all data is stationary - especially with trends and seasonality
often data is not stationary but the differences might be stationary
example:
  - first order difference D(1)t = (xt - xt-1) # difference of consecutive observations
  - second order difference D(2)t = (xt - xt-1) - (xt-1 - xt-2) # difference of differences
  - third order difference D(3)t = [(xt - xt-1) - (xt-1 - xt-2)] - [(xt-1 - xt-2) - (xt-2 - xt-3)] # differences of the differences of differences!
any of these processes can be stationary
  - dth order differences = continuing our model difference model on to all possible difference values - d times


Auto Regression:
predicting the current value based on previous time period's values
regression = predicting a value based on other factors - simple idea of regression
auto = instead of using other factors, we use earlier values of the same variable we want to predict
Auto Regression typically only works with time series data
when used in forecasting - the exponential smoothing equation is a type of Auto Regression
exponential smoothing uses the same data from previous periods to make a new prediction
we could also use just a few previous data points - i.e. certain p time periods
order p -Autoregressive models St is a function of {xt, xt-1, xt-2, ... xt-(p-1)} # we only go back p time periods

# in ARIMA we combine autoregression and differencing together!
= autoregression on the differences
= use p time periods of previous observations to predict d-th order differences!
- instead of using autoregression on the actual observed data we use autoregression on the differences
- we use p time periods to predict dth differences!!!

Moving Average:
in addition to using previous values to calculate new dth distances in ARIMA...
ARIMA will also use previous errors as predictors = et = (xhatt - xt)
this is the moving average component of ARIMA
we use order q moving averages - going back q time periods - to obtain the errors {et-1, et-2,...,et-q} to use a predictors in our model
this would be an ordered q moving average


ARIMA Model is based on p, d, q:
Formula:
  - D(d)t = u sumof(p)(alphai * D(d)t-i) - sumof(q)(thetai*(xhatt-i - xt- i))
  - we have dth order differences
  - pth order autoregression
  - qth order moving average
stats software can help tune the p d and q to find the best parameters for the ARIMA model
as with all models - there is an underlying optimization problem used to find the best tuned parameters!

This lesson covered the general ARIMA model:
- we can add seasonality to this model
- there are specific values of p d and q that relate the ARIMA model to other populate models
- ARIMA(0,0,0) = white noise model
- ARIMA(0,1,0) = random walk
- ARIMA(p, 0, 0) = ARIMA with only the Autoregressive component = AR model
- ARIMA(0,0,q) - ARIMA with only the moving average component = MA model
- ARIMA(0,1,1) - ARIMA with no autoregression component = the basic exponential smoothing model!

ARIMA is flexible (based on p, d, q) and can generalize to simpler models
ARIMA can be used for short term forecasting
ARIMA works better on more stable data (needs about 40 data points to forecast well)

# coming up next...
ARIMA models - help estimate or forecast a value (the actual prediction)
ARIMA models - can also help estimate or forecast variance!!
how and why we would do this is coming up soon!
