# Week 3 Exponential Smoothing

Exponential Smoothing:
- analyze time series data - same response is known for many time periods

where does exponential smoothing come from?

smoothing:
- remember our exponential smoothing equation
- St = alpha * xt + (1 - alpha)* St-1
- single exponential smoothing case to build up to trend and seasonality - they work the same way
- assume alpha that is between 1 and 0
- we see that alpha will compress peaks and valleys
- St = .5*xt + .5*St-1
= High xt: St not as high it is pulled down by (1-alpha)*St-1
= Low xt: not as low; pulled up by (1-alpha)*St-1
- this means all peaks and valleys are smoothed out!
- the equation is weighted to compress the values of the current estimate to reduce random noise

exponential:
- remember the equation of single exponential smoothing: St = alpha * xt + (1-alpha)*St-1
- remember St-1 is the previous baseline estimate at time t-1
- we can unfold this equation and write is as the form of our original St
- this means: St-1 can be written as: St-1 = alpha * xt-1 + (1- alpha) * St-2
- St-1 = (alpha * xt-1) + (1- alpha) * St-2
- this makes our entire equation: (alpha * xt) + (1-alpha)*[(alpha * xt-1) + (1- alpha) * St-2]
- we do this by substituting our new formula for St-1 into the back of our original St formula
- we can keep doing this - notice the St-2 equation can be rewritten again!
- we can do this forever! our equation is of the exponential form
- when we look at our equation for St - we can see each observation going back into the past each weighted by 1 - alpha to an increasing exponent!
- this is where exponential comes from!
- our values of the previous baseline actuals are weighted by alpha and an exponent from the time they occurred
- this is the extended from of exponential smoothing
- in the basic equation it looks like only xt is used...but this is not true!
- past history is folded into the previous baseline estimate but it still contributes to the equation!
- more recent observations are more important right? is this accounted for? yes!
- newer observations are weighted more based on the exponential smoothing applied to the alpha weight for the previous period's baseline!

# Summary
Exponential Smoothing:
- smooth's out jumps in observed data
- exponential weighting of all past observations
- more recent observations are more important to the current baseline estimate
