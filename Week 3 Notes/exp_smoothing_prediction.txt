# Week 3 Forecasting

exponential smoothing - analyzing time series data
- smooths out randomness
- gives clearer picture of the baseline picture
- can also give predictions in the future

Prediction with Exponential Smoothing:

we know the basic exponential smoothing equation:
- St = alpha * xt + (1 - alpha)*St-1

we want to look ahead to a time period t+1
we do not know what t+1 is...it is unknown...our best guess would be xt+1 = St
we just use the previous period's baseline estimate
our guess for the next time period is defined by this formula:
  - Ft+1 = alpha * St + (1-alpha)*St
  - therefore, Ft+1 = St
  - meaning our best forecast of Ft+1 is our previous baseline St
  - we can continue this forever
  - the further in the future we go the more error we expect
  - this also extrapolates to the case of including a trend in our exponential smoothing model
  = the best estimate of the trend is the most current trend estimate!
  - Ft+1 = St + Tt (current period baseline + current period Trend)
  - this also can help us generalize this equation using a multiplicative seasonality (cycles)
  - remember the equation: St = (alpha*xt / Ct-L) + (1 - alpha)(St-1 + Tt-1)
  - the best estimate of the next time periods seasonality factor is:
          - Ct+1 = C(t+1) - L
  - our forecast for time period t+1 is:
          - Ft+1 = (St + Tt)*C(t+1) - L

how do we train our model to tune values of alpha, beta, and gamma?
we do this by optimization: min(Ft - xt)^2
we measure the squared error and minimize it over the whole training set!
whatever alpha, beta, and gamma value give the best fit - those are the values we tune to!

Exponential Smoothing can smooth historical trends and perform short-run forecasting (prediction)
