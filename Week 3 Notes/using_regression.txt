# Week 3 Notes Using Regression

regression can answer two types of questions
- descriptive questions about how systems work
- predictive questions about what will happen

regression visually: y = a0 + a1*x1 + ... + am*xm
looking for a line that minimizes the sum of squared distances!

this lesson will focus on how to interpret regression coefficients:
say we use data to generate a regression line
y = a0 + a1*x1 + ... + am * xm
a0, a1...am are coefficients that best fit the data
- to answer questions on how systems work the key answers are the coefficients themselves
- to answer prediction questions - the response for all inputted variables is the key answer!

summary:
two uses: describe and predict
these are two of the main pillars of analytics:
- descriptive analytics, predictive analytics
- regression is not the best at providing the right course of action = prescriptive

future: random forests, transformations, decision trees + branching
