# Week 3 Intro to Exponential Smoothing

analyzing time series data - same event for many different time periods
time series has some variation - trends over time
increasing / decreasing , cyclical variations, annual

randomness: all things vary based on randomness
everything has random variation

exponential smoothing helps us ferret out the baseline through the noise in time series data
  St: the expected baseline response at time period t; expected value based on t time
  xt: the observed response at time t

what is the value over time without variation?
- is there a true increase in the baseline or just random noise

Two Answers:
- St = xt = the observed blood pressure is a real indicator of the baseline (changes were signal)
- St = St-1 = today's baseline is the same as yesterday's baseline (changes were random noise)

Solution: Exponential Smoothing combines both ideas above
- St - alpha * xt + (1-alpha)*St-1
- alpha is just a number between 0 and 1
- if there is a lot of randomness in our system - we should interpret most changes are noise - alpha goes to 0
- if there is not much randomness then alpha should be closer to 1 - changes today may mean the baseline has actually changed!

# Next Lesson:
how do we start this process?
initial condition: S(1) = x(1)
then we build up from there...

this method does not deal with trends or cyclical variation...yet...
but exponential smoothing models can be modified to account for these patterns
