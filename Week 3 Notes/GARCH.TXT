# Week 3 Notes: GARCH

exponential smoothing and it's generalization ARIMA - forecasting for time series data

time series data = data for which we have the same response over many time periods

# Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH method)
- estimate or forecast of the variance of time series data
- differs from exponential smoothing and ARIMA in that is estimates variance (e), not a response value
- why would we want to focus on estimating variance?
  - knowing the variance we can estimate the error in our normal response forecasts
  - important in investments - portfolio optimization - expected return balanced by amount of volatility
  - the variance is often used as a proxy for error or risk

GARCH Model:
- very similar to the ARIMA model in previous lessons
- sigma^2t = weight + sumof(Bi*sigma^2t-i) + sumof(gamma * e^2t-i)
- there are only two differences
- we are dealing with variances and squared errors rather than observations and linear error returns
- second - we only deal with the variances - we don't use the difference of variances like we use differences of observations in ARIMA
- other than these terms the formula structure is very similar
- GARCH p q does not need a d parameter it does not use differences

Summary:
- covered three methods for analyzing time series
- exponential smoothing
- ARIMA (generalized exponential smoothing)
- GARCH (ARIMA like model to estimate variance of time series data)
