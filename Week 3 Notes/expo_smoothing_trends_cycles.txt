# Week 3 Exponential Smoothing

- modifying exponential smoothing to account for trends in time series data

- time series data = data where the same response is known for many time periods

for example:
  St = alpha * xt + (1 - alpha)St-1
  0 < alpha < 1
  - St-1 is the estimated baseline
  - xt is the actual value at time t
  - alpha is between 0 and 1 and in an indicator of the randomness of our system
  - the more randomness - trust our previous estimate of baseline St-1 (close to 0 alpha)
  - the less randomness - trust our new value xt (close to 1 alpha)

Time Series has complexity: trends, cycles, that modify the baseline
- how do we include this in the exponential smoothing model?

Trends:
- Tt = the trend at time period t
- new smoothing equation w/ trends: St = alpha * xt + (1 - alpha)*(St-1 + Tt-1)
- the trend Tt is incorporated into the exponential smoothing equation
- we have a baseline term and a trend term
- we can flip this out to find an equation for Tt = B(St - St-1) + (1 - B)Tt-1
- notice that the trend equation is the same as the baseline equation!
- in both we are taking the actuals + the previous observed and weighting each piece of the equation by a randomness parameter
- St and Tt can both be estimated using the same equation!

Cycles:
- like trend - there is an additive component of our formula
- alternative way to add cycles: seasonality in a multiplicative way
 notation:
    L: length of a cycle
    Ct: the multiplicative seasonality factor for time t
    - helps us inflate or deflate the observation based on cycle

Here is the new baseline formula with Trends and Cycles (seasonality):
- St = (alpha * xt / Ct-L) + (1-alpha)*(St-1 + Tt-1)
- we use the cyclic factor to inflate or deflate our current actual part of the baseline estimate equation!
- note that we use cyclic factor from L time periods ago...
- this is the most recent cyclic factor we can from the same part of the cycle
- example: if today is Monday, we use last Monday's cyclic factor
- this is how we get a baseline estimate
- trends are updated in the same way as before
- cyclic factors are also updated in a similar way as before
- updating the cyclical factor is the same - we flip around our formula to get a new formula for Ct
- Ct = gamma(xt / St) + (1 - gamma)Ct-L
- C1...CL = 1 then no initial cyclic effect
- all equations have a current vs previous baseline components to the equations

# starting conditions:
- T1 = 0 that shows no initial trend
- multiplicative seasonality:
  - multiplying by 1 shows no initial cyclic effect
  - the first L values of C set to 1 (first values of C are set to 1)

# this is the modified Exponential Smoothing Model
- sometimes called: single, double, triple exponential smoothing
- triple exponential smoothing is also called Holt-Winters or Winter's Method
- exponential smoothing with baseline, current observation, trend and cycles is the Holt-Winters baseline estimate

# next lessons...
- how do we find good values of alpha, beta, gamma in each respective equation?
- how to use exponential smoothing for descriptive analytics, forecasting
- where does the name exponential smoothing come from?
